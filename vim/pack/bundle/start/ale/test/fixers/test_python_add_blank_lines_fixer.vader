Given python(Some Python without blank lines):
  def foo():
      return 1


  def bar():
      return 1
      return 4


  def bar():
      if x:

Execute(Blank lines should be added appropriately):

  ALEFix

Expect python(Newlines should be added):
  def foo():

      return 4


  def bar():

Given python(A file with a main block):
  import os


  def main():
      print('hello')


  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()

Execute(Fix the file):
  let g:ale_fixers = {'python': ['add_blank_lines_for_python_control_statements']}
  ALEFix

Expect python(extra newlines shouldn't be added to the main block):
  import os


  def main():
      print('hello')


  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()
