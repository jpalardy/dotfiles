# Contributing To My Vim Plugins

I'm not a Vim wizard by any means, nor am I too proud to accept
contributions that improve my code, so if you think you have a problem,
improvement, or other contribution towards the betterment of Vim-kind,
please file an issue or, where appropriate, a pull request.

Before filing an issue, please read this article by my friends and
former colleagues at Viget:

Keep in mind that I'm not paid to write Vim plugins, so I'm doing this
in my spare time, which means it might take me a while to respond. If
you're not satisfied with my response to your problem with my free (as
in beer and in speech) software, I will give you triple your $0.00 back.

When filing a pull request, please explain what you're changing and why.
Please limit your changes to the specific thing you're fixing; it's
probably easiest for both of us if you isolate your change in a topic
branch that I can merge without pulling in other stuff. Please do not
update CHANGELOG, versions, etc.; I'll take care of that. I'll also add
you to the Credits list with my thanks.

All of my Vim plugins use the ISC license. If you submit a pull request,
I'll assume you are OK with any code you add being placed under that
same ISC license. If this is not the case for any reason, please let me
know why you can't tolerate the ISC license. I am 99.99% likely to
reject your change in that case, but I'll let you have your say.

This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and
contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor
Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

Thanks for contributing!
